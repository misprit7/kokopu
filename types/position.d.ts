/**
 * @class
 * @classdesc Represent a chess position, i.e. the state of a 64-square chessboard with a few additional
 *            information (who is about to play, castling rights, en-passant rights).
 *
 * @description
 * This constructor can be invoked with different types of arguments:
 * ```
 * new kokopu.Position('regular');                  //  1 -> Usual starting position.
 * new kokopu.Position('regular', 'start');         //  2 -> Same as 1.
 * new kokopu.Position('regular', 'empty');         //  3 -> Empty board.
 * new kokopu.Position('no-king', 'empty');         //  4 -> Empty board, configured to be considered as legal without any king.
 * new kokopu.Position('white-king-only', 'empty'); //  5 -> Empty board, configured to be considered as legal with no black king.
 * new kokopu.Position('black-king-only', 'empty'); //  6 -> Empty board, configured to be considered as legal with no white king.
 * new kokopu.Position('chess960', 'empty');        //  7 -> Empty board, configured for Chess960.
 * new kokopu.Position('chess960', scharnaglCode);  //  8 -> One of the Chess960 starting position (`scharnaglCode` is a number between 0 and 959 inclusive).
 * new kokopu.Position(variant, fenString);         //  9 -> Parse the given FEN string, assuming the given game variant.
 * new kokopu.Position(anotherPosition);            // 10 -> Make a copy of `anotherPosition`.
 * ```
 * Please note that the argument `'regular'` can be omitted in forms 1, 2, 3. In particular, the constructor can be invoked
 * with no argument, as in `new kokopu.Position()`: in this case, a new `Position` initialized to the usual starting position
 * is instantiated (as in forms 1 and 2).
 *
 * In form 9, `variant` must be one of the game variant proposed in {@link GameVariant}. The `variant` argument can be omitted,
 * as in `new kokopu.Position(fenString)`: in this case, the usual chess rules are assumed (as if `variant` where set to `'regular'`).
 * If `variant` is set to `'chess960'`, then the X-FEN syntax can be used for `fenString'`.
 *
 * In form 10, `anotherPosition` must be another {@link Position} object.
 *
 * @throws {module:exception.InvalidFEN} If the input parameter is not a valid FEN string (can be thrown only in cases 6 and 7).
 *
